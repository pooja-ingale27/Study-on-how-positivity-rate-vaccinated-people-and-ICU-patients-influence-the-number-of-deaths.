1. Introduction
   
COVID-19, first identified in China in December 2019, was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The UK reported its first case in January 2020. Between March 2020 and July 2022, COVID-19 caused around 185,114 deaths in the UK, with major social and emotional impacts.

2. Aims and Objectives
   
The study aims to predict COVID-19 deaths in the UK based on:

ICU patients

Positive test rates

Number of people vaccinated

3. Methodology

Multivariate Linear Regression was used to model the relationship between deaths (dependent variable) and the three predictors.

4. Results & Discussion
   
Correlation:

ICU patients: Strong positive correlation with deaths (0.93)

Positive rates: Moderate positive correlation (0.51)

Vaccinated people: Moderate negative correlation (-0.55)
